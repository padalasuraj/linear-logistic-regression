# 🧠 **Linear Regression Project**

## 📚 **Overview**

Welcome to the **Linear Regression Project**! This repository contains implementations of Linear Regression using both analytical methods and Gradient Descent. The project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how linear regression works under the hood.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Running the Scripts
Linear Regression with Normal Equation:

📊 Visualization
This project includes visualization tools to help you better understand the regression model's fit:

Scatter Plot: Displays data points.
Regression Line: Shows the best-fit line overlay.
To visualize the results, ensure matplotlib is installed, then run the script. The plot will be displayed or saved in the plots/ directory (if configured).

📏 Performance Evaluation
Evaluate the model’s performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE). The script will print the MSE value, helping you understand the model's accuracy.

⚙️ Customization
Learning Rate: Modify the learning rate for Gradient Descent by changing the learning_rate parameter in linear_regression_gd.py.
Number of Iterations: Adjust the number of iterations for Gradient Descent by changing the n_iterations parameter.
Visualization Settings: Customize the plot appearance by modifying matplotlib settings in the script.
